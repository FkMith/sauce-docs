Hosted Orchestration runs mobile and browser tests up to 70% faster, from within the Sauce Labs grid via our container execution environment. All you need to do is package your test code as a Docker image and grant us access.

Hosted Orchestration is different from traditional remote grid execution because it removes a large portion of  network traffic, which drastically increases the amount of time to execute a test suite from your environment.
